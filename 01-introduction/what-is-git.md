# What is Git?

Git is a version control system used to track changes in files over time.

It was designed to be:
- Fast
- Secure
- Distributed
- Reliable for teamwork

## Why Git exists

Git allows developers to:

1. Save multiple versions of the same project
2. Track changes using simple commands
3. Work simultaneously on different features
4. Collaborate with other developers without breaking the main code

Git makes it possible to work on the same project safely and efficiently.
