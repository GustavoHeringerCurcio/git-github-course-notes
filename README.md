## 📌 About this repository

This repository contains my **personal study notes on Git and GitHub**, created while studying version control concepts and practicing them locally.

The notes are based on:
- 📺 A **15-lesson introductory YouTube course**  
- 👨‍🏫 **Instructor:** Tiago Matos  
- 🎓 **Course:** *Curso gratuito de Git e GitHub* (introductory level)

All notes here were written **by me**, in my own words, while following the course and practicing the commands.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Document my learning journey with Git and GitHub
- Reinforce fundamental version control concepts
- Practice writing clear technical documentation
- Publicly show real and structured study progress on GitHub

This repository is meant to reflect **learning in progress**, not mastery.
