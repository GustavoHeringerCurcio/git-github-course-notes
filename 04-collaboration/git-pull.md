```md
# git pull

The `git pull` command downloads and integrates changes
from a remote repository into the local repository.

## Example with two developers

- Developer A pushes changes to GitHub
- Developer B has an outdated version

Before continuing work, Developer B should run:

```bash
git pull
```

After that, both developers are synchronized.

# Best practice

- Pull frequently
- Pull before starting work
- Pull before pushing changes
